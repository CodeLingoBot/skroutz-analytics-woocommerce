This plugin will add the settings to the WooCommerce Integration tab `WooCommerce > Settings > Integration > Skroutz Analytics`

##### I don't see the code on my site. Where is it?
Make sure you have set your Skroutz Analytics `Shop Account ID` in the plugin settings, otherwise the tracking won't work.

##### Which pages do you track?
This plugin does not track any admin pages, only frontend pages.
